# Border Blaster (Tiny Build)

Border Blaster is a lighthearted, top-down RPG that teaches African geography through exploration, NPC dialogue, and pop-culture flavored storytelling. The tiny build focuses on five countries — Egypt, Kenya, Tanzania, Morocco, and South Africa — to prove out the vibe before expanding to the full continent.

## Purpose
- Help players learn African geography through playful exploration.
- Blend humor, culture, and quick facts delivered via NPC chats and region discovery.
- Provide a flexible scaffold for adding quests, Culture Cores, bosses, and accurate maps later.

## Project Structure
```
root
├─ index.html        # Game canvas + HUD
├─ style.css         # Simple, clean cartoon aesthetic
├─ game.js           # Core gameplay: map, movement, NPCs, HUD
└─ README.md         # Project overview and contributor notes
```

## Running the Game Locally
1. Open `index.html` directly in your browser (no build tools required).
2. Move with Arrow Keys or WASD, stand next to an NPC to trigger dialog, and watch the HUD update as you cross borders.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages
1. Commit your changes and push to GitHub.
2. In your repository settings, enable GitHub Pages and select the `main` (or default) branch as the source.
3. Wait a minute for Pages to build, then visit the provided URL to play from the cloud.

## Future Expansion Ideas
- Add sprites/tilesets for biomes, NPCs, and the player character.
- Introduce quests, collectibles, and boss encounters themed around regional culture.
- Increase map accuracy with real-world geography and travel gates.
- Expand the map to all African countries with deeper lore and mini-games.
- Layer in sound effects, music, and accessibility options.

## Contributing
- Keep code commented for clarity and extensibility.
- Maintain the playful tone and educational focus.
- Favor data-driven definitions for maps, NPCs, and quests to make iteration easy.
